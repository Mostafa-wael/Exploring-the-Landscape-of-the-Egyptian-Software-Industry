The initiative falls under the pillar “Egyptian Human Development”, a key pillar of MCIT strategy for building Digital Egypt.

The initiative seeks to empower the next generation of Egyptian young graduates of engineering and computer science colleges to become leaders at the global level and be capable of implementing Egypt’s digital vision.

The initiative offers, annually, a free scholarship to 1,000 top graduate students from engineering and computer science colleges; they will be selected according to specific conditions and admission criteria to be prepared as young cadres in various fields, including data science, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, robotics, automation and digital arts. In addition, they will be assigned to a training program on leadership and management skills. 

DEBI is implemented in cooperation with a number of major international universities, specializing in new technology fields, and local and global companies, working in the fields of ICT or in development of leadership or language skills; those global universities grant technical Master’s degree in the field of ICT or a professional Master’s degree according to the certificate provided by the university. As for companies, they will conduct workshops in different technology areas, contribute to enriching the educational process and provide training programs to develop students’ skills and grant them approved certificates once their training is completed. Each student also receives a certificate in leadership and management skills and an English proficiency certificate from specialized global companies.

It was the third university in Egypt after Fouad I University and Farouk I University (Cairo and Alexandria Universities). After the 1952 revolution, it was thought that it would be more appropriate to assign the university a name, Heliopolis “the city of the sun” that would be a permanent reminder of the oldest Egyptian University in history that was very famous in science and astronomy in the pharaonic era. In November 1952, the historical Zaafran palace was chosen to be the university headquarters. The palace was surrounded by 100 acres of green area. It was established during the period of Ismail Pasha. The Egyptian–English treaty was signed there in 1936. In 1954, at the recommendation of the university council, a law was passed changing the name to the “University of Ain Shams”. During the last few years, the palace was renovated to maintain its original architectural as well as artistic features. Throughout its history, the university has always been in continuous development. Its graduates are highly distinguished in the employment market. The university includes the following faculties and institutes: Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Commerce, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Women for Arts, Science and Education, Faculty of Languages (Al–Alsun), Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Faculty of Computer Science and Information, Faculty of Nursing, Institute of Environmental Studies and Research and Institute of Postgraduate Childhood Studies.",,102604.0,http://eng.shams.edu.eg,eng.shams.edu.eg,,EG,,Education Administration Programs,"501-1,000 employees",,,653005.0,653005,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/company/653005/,1651.0,"Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University",https://www.linkedin.com/company/653005/,2023-05-05T03:14:50.661Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/faculty-of-engineering-ain-shams-university/,,,

In September 1999, Egypt launched the National Program to develop the Communications and Information Technology (ICT) sector in Egypt. The program aims to foster the development of an information society in Egypt and stimulate the growth of a strong, competitive, vibrant, export-oriented ICT sector. The cornerstone of this program was the establishment of the new Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, in October 1999, to lead these efforts.

Then, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) launched a National Plan for ICT, establishing multi-disciplinary projects and initiatives related to vital sectors, such as education and health.

Our mission is to create meaningful jobs for millions of people, by teaching them how to build human-centered AI products.

Our Philosophy

In the age of software, innovative organizations invest significantly to build their own proprietary digital products that offer a great User Experience (UX) and leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI).

This omnipresent AI software layer opens a new dimension where operations, products and services merge into one user experience. Whether the user is an employee, another business, or a customer, the cost, speed, and ease of utilizing the AI layer becomes the most important differentiators between winners and losers in globally competitive marketplaces.

Off the shelf software does not differentiate you, nor does it provide the integration, flexibility, and affordability you need to succeed. In the age of software, we believe the only way to win is through bespoke digital products where you own the IP and have the ability to prioritize new features.

However, building teams that build AI with great UX is incredibly hard. Our value proposition is that we provide you with teams that will design, build, support and maintain those products.

Why choose bld.ai

Experience. Our team has been building AI software with great UX for 20 years. We have both the academic and practical experience required to manage expectations and focus on the important parts of building machine learning engines successfully.

Speed. We deploy nimble teams of 3-7 people to quickly build tools, deploy features and improve functionality. Most importantly, our teams have worked together in the past and operate as full stack, end-to-end squads.

IP Ownership. All the IP we create is the sole property of those we serve. We build it from the ground up working hand-in-hand with you. Bespoke software is less expensive and provides better integration and scale.","Let’s design, build, and maintain human-centered AI products together.",6756.0,https://bld.ai,https://bld.ai,Boca Raton,"Boca Raton, FL 33496, US",,Internet Publishing,201-500 employees,"Boca Raton, FL",2017.0,13653729.0,13653729,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/company/13653729/,225.0,bld.ai,https://www.linkedin.com/company/13653729/,2023-05-05T03:56:34.988Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/bldai/,"UI design, UX design, Data Science, AI, Software Development, and Product Management",,

What we do:

Movemeback is a members-only community, connecting overseas leaders, influencers, talent and organisations to unique, exclusive and exciting high potential opportunities on the African continent. We focus on distinctive and non-cliché opportunities from senior leadership roles with Africa’s most influential organisations through to unique investments, creative and entrepreneurial partnerships, nation shaping, social impact and more. We’re structured to enable talent relocation - including internships, secondments or remote engagements - and the facilitation of investment and advisory relationships. We're also focused on supporting the move to the continent through services, insights, content and access to a collaborative community.

Our Vision:

Movemeback aspires to become the internationally trusted channel through which Africa interacts and partners with individuals, organisations and institutions across the rest of the world, specifically but by no means limited to those individuals and organisations that represent the African diaspora.

It was established in 2007 with the mission of providing the best comprehensive family centered quality care and a chance for cure to all children with cancer seeking its services, free of charge and without discrimination.

Initially, since the inception of the 57357 Project, the focus was on how to provide the best comprehensive quality care and an opportunity for cure. Hence, the Hospital is constantly offering its patients a wide range of the most updated diagnostics and treatment services including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, bone marrow transplant, multi-disciplinary clinics, physical rehabilitation, socio-psychological care, palliative care, survivorship care and in-house schooling.",,33690.0,http://www.57357.org,57357.org,Cairo,"1 Seket El Emam Street, Cairo, Sayeda Zeinab 11441, EG",19057,Hospitals and Health Care,"1,001-5,000 employees","Cairo, Sayeda Zeinab",2007.0,19101321.0,19101321,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/company/19101321/,629.0,Children's Cancer Hospital Foundation 57357,https://www.linkedin.com/company/19101321/,2023-05-05T04:17:32.102Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/children-s-cancer-hospital-foundation-57357/,,,

We empower global retail leaders to make better decisions by fusing all sources of data into a clear view across the business.
 
For over 13 years, we have been helping our clients to better understand their business by consolidating complex insights into compelling stories, with distinct chapters and clear plotlines leading to epiphanies of “I know exactly what actions to take next” for our clients.
 
The Fusion MethodTM takes the bias and politics out of competing data sets. It provides the best customized analytics, advanced mathematically modeling, and speed to fuse multiple data sources from inside and outside the organization. With its ability to generate unique perspectives and drive clear actions, Fusion is the secret weapon for growing retailers, and is the only data analytics and advisory company that delivers One Version of The Truth across your enterprise. 
 
We achieve all the above by mathematically fusing over 42 internal & external data sources and over 140 enterprise metrics measured across the organization via our proprietary AI model built off of Bayesian statistics. As a wholly different statistical paradigm from traditional methods, Bayesian statistics has been explored and validated for three centuries but has only recently become practical with advances in AI.
 
The Fusion Process:
 
- Uncover and remove all blind spots in the business
- Triangulate multiple data sources for each metric to remove noise and find 
 the actual signal
- Fuse/integrate all the metrics so you can see a clear picture of what is working and what is not
- Rack & stack the results into clear outlines so your team can prioritize
- Work with you to build an action plan, then implement and review

Det omfatter tre kommuner: Oslo, Asker og Bærum. I geografisk utstrekning er det derimot et lite politidistrikt, men har ansvar for en relativt stor del av den registrerte kriminaliteten i Norge.

Distriktet har ca. 3000 ansatte: 66,2% er politi, 5,3% er jurister og 26,4% er sivilt ansatte. Det gir Oslo politidistrikt en politidekning på 2,17 per 1000 innbygger.

Oslo politidistrikt har flere oppgaver av nasjonal karakter. Hovedstaden er både sete for Kongehus, Storting og regjering - det er også her departementene og hovedtyngden av direktoratene, og kultur- og finansinstitusjonene er plassert. I tillegg ligger Beredskapstroppen, Helikoptertjenesten, Bombegruppen og Krise- og gisselforhandlingsseksjonen til distriktet.

Reform 2015–2016
Som ledd i nærpolitireformen ble Oslo politidistrikt slått sammen med Asker og Bærum politidistrikt 1. januar 2016. Alle landets politidistrikter er i dag organisert likt (unntaket for Oslo er de nasjonale bistandsressursene):
- Felles enhet for operativ tjeneste
- Felles kriminalenhet
- Felles enhet for etterretning og etterforskning
- Felles enhet for forebygging
- Felles enhet for påtale

Connecting healthcare professionals to educational, professional and business opportunities around the globe through accessible, convenient and cost-effective technology-based solutions to contribute to the knowledge and professional growth of the health workforce.

Bonocle was founded by 4 engineers who have a passion for technology and innovation. Bonocle's first innovation is a device for the visually impaired (Ironically named Bonocle) that allows them to interpret the contents of any electronic device through the medium of braille. It does so while being both portable, powerful and, cheap! This is unprecedented; since many from the visually impaired community lacked adequate access to digital content mainly due to the extremely expensive currently available braille technologies. Bonocle also has an API that will allow developers to expand its usability by creating custom applications for Bonocle and the visually impaired community.

The company's vision does not end with Bonocle. Our plan is to continue innovating, creating and solving technological problems that today's world and communities face.

It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.

An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate. There are active PostgreSQL systems in production environments that manage in excess of 4 terabytes of data.",The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database,13538.0,https://www.postgresql.org/,https://postgresql.org,,US,,IT Services and IT Consulting,51-200 employees,,,758353.0,758353,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/company/758353/,69.0,PostgreSQL Global Development Group,https://www.linkedin.com/company/758353/,2023-05-05T11:04:12.655Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/postgresql-global-development-group/,,,

Many fields can benefit greatly from this technology, be it robotics, mobility, logistics, finance or healthcare.

These were the faculties of Arts and Law. The faculty of Engineering was then established in 1941.

In the light of the need for developing more disciplines for higher learning and with a view towards meeting the need of the people of Alexandria, Alexandria University became a separate entity in August 1942 with four additional faculties: Science, Commerce, Medicine and Agriculture.

In 1952, it became ""Alexandria University""​. Since then, the University witnessed growth and expansion in several fields: the number of Faculties and high institutes increased to 22. Some example of them are as follows:

Faculty of Nursing, 1954 (formerly, High Institute of Nursing)
Faculty of Pharmacy, 1956
High Institute of Public Health, 1963
Faculty of Education, 1969
Faculty of Dentistry, 1971
Medical Research Institute, 1971
Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, 1974
Institute of Graduate Studies & Research, 1983
Faculty of Tourism and Hotels, 1983

Alexandria University supervised the establishment of four faculties in the Nile Delta. Those were: Faculty of Medicine (1962) and Faculties of Science (1969) in Tanta (currently Tanta University), Education and Agriculture (1969) in Kafr-Elsheikh (currently Kafr-Elsheikh University).

Seven other Faculties were established in Damanhour, the capital of Behera Governorate: the Faculty of Education (1980), the Faculties of Arts, Agriculture, and Commerce (1983), Science, Veterinary Medicine, and Nursing (2007).( currently Damanhour University)

In 1989, the Faculties and Institute affiliated to Helwan University and located in Alexandria joined the Alexandria University by a Presidential Decree: four Faculties of Physical Education for men, Physical Education for women, fine Arts, and agriculture at Saba-Basha.

A Faculty of Basic Education was also establi...",,231941.0,http://www.alexu.edu.eg/,alexu.edu.eg,Alexandria,"El-Guish Road, El-Shatby, Alexandria, Alexandria, Alexandria 21526, EG",(03)5921675/6/7/8,Higher Education,"10,001+ employees","Alexandria, Alexandria",1938.0,2049284.0,2049284,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/company/2049284/,5733.0,Alexandria University,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2049284/,2023-05-05T13:36:12.928Z,https://www.linkedin.com/school/alexandria-university/,,,

Building great software needs a great business culture, an effective software process, technical expertise, and discipline.

We are a group of software practitioners who are passionate about building high-quality software solutions and helping others do the same.  We develop software and train/coach our clients in creating a great culture, choosing and tailoring an appropriate process, and learning technical skills such as test-driven development, evolutionary design, and continuous delivery.

The company was closed in June 2016.
Mostly due to the loss of a highly valued customer who shut down a large project, with which ICCC A/S had been deeply involved for more than 25 years.

That said, this was expected a few years ahead, but various attempts to establish a new customer base did unfortunately fail.

A promising partnership with LivePerson, to be their agent in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland and Greenland, was established too late to generate the necessary turnover. ICCC A/S delivered “LiveEngage”, LivePerson’s leading cloud-based customer engagement solution.

A brief outline of the company’s history.

ICCC A/S was founded in 1982 by a group of highly skilled and experienced computer consultants. The focus was in the areas of data- and telecommunication, wired as well as wireless networks based upon the companys multi-host access system UNA® (Universal Network Access). The keyword in the UNA-system is connectivity between different networking environments. ICCC A/S was both a software and hardware development house specialized in data communication, integration of data, telephony and complex system specification.

Over the years ICCC A/S delivered various products to several customers, too many to cover here.

But you may use the Internet Wayback Machine to dig into the companys old websites, which provides more information. https://web.archive.org/web/*/iccc.dk

The company went through one reconstruction in 2004 and one bankruptcy in 2009. From 2009, until the bankruptcy in 2016, it was (formally) a new company, investors being 2 former employees and 1 external. Some of the previous employees stayed with the new company, securing a flow of knowledge.

Following Chase's decision to divest its equity stake in 1987, NBE increased its shareholding to 99.9%, changing the Bank’s name to Commercial International Bank (Egypt) S.A.E. NBE’s stake gradually decreased through several public offerings till reaching 18.7%. In 2006, a Consortium led by Ripplewood Holdings acquired NBE stake. In July 2009, Actis, a leading emerging markets private equity firm, invested US$ 244 million to get shares in CIB, acquiring hence 50% of the Ripplewood Holdings Consortium’s stake. Five months later, Ripplewood sold its remaining 4.7% stake over the open market, marking the successful transition of strategic partnership to be with Actis, who then became CIB’s largest shareholder with a 9.1% stake. In March 2014,Actis sold a portion of its holding, representing 2.6% of the Bank’s total outstanding shares, in the open market to a group of international investors. In May 2014, Actis, successfully realised its investment in CIB and sold its remaining 6.5% to Subsidiaries wholly owned by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd “Fairfax”.
