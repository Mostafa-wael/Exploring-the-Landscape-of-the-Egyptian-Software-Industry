These were the faculties of Arts and Law. The faculty of Engineering was then established in 1941.

In the light of the need for developing more disciplines for higher learning and with a view towards meeting the need of the people of Alexandria, Alexandria University became a separate entity in August 1942 with four additional faculties: Science, Commerce, Medicine and Agriculture.

In 1952, it became ""Alexandria University""​. Since then, the University witnessed growth and expansion in several fields: the number of Faculties and high institutes increased to 22. Some example of them are as follows:

Faculty of Nursing, 1954 (formerly, High Institute of Nursing)
Faculty of Pharmacy, 1956
High Institute of Public Health, 1963
Faculty of Education, 1969
Faculty of Dentistry, 1971
Medical Research Institute, 1971
Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, 1974
Institute of Graduate Studies & Research, 1983
Faculty of Tourism and Hotels, 1983

Alexandria University supervised the establishment of four faculties in the Nile Delta. Those were: Faculty of Medicine (1962) and Faculties of Science (1969) in Tanta (currently Tanta University), Education and Agriculture (1969) in Kafr-Elsheikh (currently Kafr-Elsheikh University).

Seven other Faculties were established in Damanhour, the capital of Behera Governorate: the Faculty of Education (1980), the Faculties of Arts, Agriculture, and Commerce (1983), Science, Veterinary Medicine, and Nursing (2007).( currently Damanhour University)

In 1989, the Faculties and Institute affiliated to Helwan University and located in Alexandria joined the Alexandria University by a Presidential Decree: four Faculties of Physical Education for men, Physical Education for women, fine Arts, and agriculture at Saba-Basha.

A Faculty of Basic Education was also establi...",,231941,Alexandria,"El-Guish Road, El-Shatby, Alexandria, Alexandria, Alexandria 21526, EG",Higher Education,"10,001+ employees",1938,,2049284,2049284,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/company/2049284/,5733,Alexandria University,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2049284/,2023-05-05T13:36:12.928Z,https://www.linkedin.com/school/alexandria-university/,http://www.alexu.edu.eg/,alexu.edu.eg,(03)5921675/6/7/8,"Alexandria, Alexandria",,

But few have the time to pay down the technical debt and refactor their software regularly.

Building great software needs a great business culture, an effective software process, technical expertise, and discipline.

We are a group of software practitioners who are passionate about building high-quality software solutions and helping others do the same.  We develop software and train/coach our clients in creating a great culture, choosing and tailoring an appropriate process, and learning technical skills such as test-driven development, evolutionary design, and continuous delivery.

The company was closed in June 2016.
Mostly due to the loss of a highly valued customer who shut down a large project, with which ICCC A/S had been deeply involved for more than 25 years.

That said, this was expected a few years ahead, but various attempts to establish a new customer base did unfortunately fail.

A promising partnership with LivePerson, to be their agent in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland and Greenland, was established too late to generate the necessary turnover. ICCC A/S delivered “LiveEngage”, LivePerson’s leading cloud-based customer engagement solution.

A brief outline of the company’s history.

ICCC A/S was founded in 1982 by a group of highly skilled and experienced computer consultants. The focus was in the areas of data- and telecommunication, wired as well as wireless networks based upon the companys multi-host access system UNA® (Universal Network Access). The keyword in the UNA-system is connectivity between different networking environments. ICCC A/S was both a software and hardware development house specialized in data communication, integration of data, telephony and complex system specification.

Over the years ICCC A/S delivered various products to several customers, too many to cover here.

But you may use the Internet Wayback Machine to dig into the companys old websites, which provides more information. https://web.archive.org/web/*/iccc.dk

The company went through one reconstruction in 2004 and one bankruptcy in 2009. From 2009, until the bankruptcy in 2016, it was (formally) a new company, investors being 2 former employees and 1 external. Some of the previous employees stayed with the new company, securing a flow of knowledge.

The organized seminars included: Ethical Hacking, Ruby on Rails & Android Mobile Applications Development, Recent Renewable Energy Sources, Mobile Communication 101, Data Field, Embedded Systems, and most important Dr. Mosutafa El Sayed’s session “Nanotechnology the future world technology of the very small”. In addition to that, the branch is recently exploring new regions by providing one-day workshops like Term’s Kickoff workshop which was a three-day workshop with three different topics for each day.

It’s about how our advanced technology would impact your business growth and contribute to your success 🙏

You may have a challenge in responding to each and every customer conversation with a relevant, personalized and satisfactory answer. But just getting a ChatBot or even a person to respond is not going to unleash insights that help you grow. Insights like which products are in demand, or most chronic customers’ complaints👇 Actually, having an ordinary chatbot or moderation team would probably disconnect you from your customers voice 😱

DXwand built a Conversational AI application that easily helps businesses turn conversations into ""Growth Insights"". It responds to conversations with ""Contextual and personalized"" approach and with AI, it converts conversations into Growth Insights Dashboards such as leads, demands, opportunities, threats, complaints and much more. Growth insights are presented to business owners to keep them connected with their customers' voice while not required to tap into every conversation and helps them take informative decisions to grow! Solution is available in Facebook Messenger, Facebook Comments, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, Website, SMS and Voice.
