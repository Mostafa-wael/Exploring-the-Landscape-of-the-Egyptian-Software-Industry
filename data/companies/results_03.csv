Following Chase's decision to divest its equity stake in 1987, NBE increased its shareholding to 99.9%, changing the Bank’s name to Commercial International Bank (Egypt) S.A.E. NBE’s stake gradually decreased through several public offerings till reaching 18.7%. In 2006, a Consortium led by Ripplewood Holdings acquired NBE stake. In July 2009, Actis, a leading emerging markets private equity firm, invested US$ 244 million to get shares in CIB, acquiring hence 50% of the Ripplewood Holdings Consortium’s stake. Five months later, Ripplewood sold its remaining 4.7% stake over the open market, marking the successful transition of strategic partnership to be with Actis, who then became CIB’s largest shareholder with a 9.1% stake. In March 2014,Actis sold a portion of its holding, representing 2.6% of the Bank’s total outstanding shares, in the open market to a group of international investors. In May 2014, Actis, successfully realised its investment in CIB and sold its remaining 6.5% to Subsidiaries wholly owned by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd “Fairfax”.
CIB is Egypt’s leading private sector bank, offering a broad range of financial products and services to its customers, including enterprises of all sizes, institutions, households and high-net worth individuals. CIB strives to provide superior financial solutions to meet all customers’ needs. Having the strongest brand equity rightfully places CIB as the bank of choice for over 500 of Egypt’s largest corporations. CIB shows tremendous potential within the bourgeoning Retail and SME Banking markets.

The Egyptian Cabinet’s Information and Decision Support Center (IDSC) stands as one of the distinguished Think Tanks in Egypt, particularly for the Cabinet. Its main task is to support decision makers with regard to economic, social and political issues, while placing emphasis on priority issues to foster the reform efforts that push the development march forward.

Moreover, IDSC strives to enhance relations with different ministries and government authorities, and to open communication channels with the public to measure the society’s attitudes towards national issues. IDSC also works on disseminating data and information, focusing on electronic dissemination.

IDSC has significantly contributed to crystallizing the opinions and concepts that have an impact on the Egyptian government’s foreign and national policies through publishing various research, covering diversified themes, as well as books and working papers. Besides, periodicals and public opinion polls are prepared. It also organizes seminars, conferences, workshops and training programs.
