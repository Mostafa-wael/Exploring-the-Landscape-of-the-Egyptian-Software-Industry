Det omfatter tre kommuner: Oslo, Asker og Bærum. I geografisk utstrekning er det derimot et lite politidistrikt, men har ansvar for en relativt stor del av den registrerte kriminaliteten i Norge.

Distriktet har ca. 3000 ansatte: 66,2% er politi, 5,3% er jurister og 26,4% er sivilt ansatte. Det gir Oslo politidistrikt en politidekning på 2,17 per 1000 innbygger.

Oslo politidistrikt har flere oppgaver av nasjonal karakter. Hovedstaden er både sete for Kongehus, Storting og regjering - det er også her departementene og hovedtyngden av direktoratene, og kultur- og finansinstitusjonene er plassert. I tillegg ligger Beredskapstroppen, Helikoptertjenesten, Bombegruppen og Krise- og gisselforhandlingsseksjonen til distriktet.

Reform 2015–2016
Som ledd i nærpolitireformen ble Oslo politidistrikt slått sammen med Asker og Bærum politidistrikt 1. januar 2016. Alle landets politidistrikter er i dag organisert likt (unntaket for Oslo er de nasjonale bistandsressursene):
- Felles enhet for operativ tjeneste
- Felles kriminalenhet
- Felles enhet for etterretning og etterforskning
- Felles enhet for forebygging
- Felles enhet for påtale
- Felles enhet for utlending og forvaltning
- Felles enhet for sivil rettspleie (namsfogd)

Bonocle was founded by 4 engineers who have a passion for technology and innovation. Bonocle's first innovation is a device for the visually impaired (Ironically named Bonocle) that allows them to interpret the contents of any electronic device through the medium of braille. It does so while being both portable, powerful and, cheap! This is unprecedented; since many from the visually impaired community lacked adequate access to digital content mainly due to the extremely expensive currently available braille technologies. Bonocle also has an API that will allow developers to expand its usability by creating custom applications for Bonocle and the visually impaired community.

The company's vision does not end with Bonocle. Our plan is to continue innovating, creating and solving technological problems that today's world and communities face.

We love setting trends, breaking the internet and going crazy with big boys toys.

Built on market research and actual numbers, we develop marketing plans to make a success story for brands... And us as well.
