The initiative falls under the pillar “Egyptian Human Development”, a key pillar of MCIT strategy for building Digital Egypt.

The initiative seeks to empower the next generation of Egyptian young graduates of engineering and computer science colleges to become leaders at the global level and be capable of implementing Egypt’s digital vision.

The initiative offers, annually, a free scholarship to 1,000 top graduate students from engineering and computer science colleges; they will be selected according to specific conditions and admission criteria to be prepared as young cadres in various fields, including data science, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, robotics, automation and digital arts. In addition, they will be assigned to a training program on leadership and management skills. 

DEBI is implemented in cooperation with a number of major international universities, specializing in new technology fields, and local and global companies, working in the fields of ICT or in development of leadership or language skills; those global universities grant technical Master’s degree in the field of ICT or a professional Master’s degree according to the certificate provided by the university. As for companies, they will conduct workshops in different technology areas, contribute to enriching the educational process and provide training programs to develop students’ skills and grant them approved certificates once their training is completed. Each student also receives a certificate in leadership and management skills and an English proficiency certificate from specialized global companies.  

After the termination of the scholarship and completion of graduation projects students will be highly qualified to work in digital transformation projects, to support building Digital Egypt.",,6340,http://www.debi.gov.eg,debi.gov.eg,,,15388,Education Administration Programs,11-50 employees,,2020,69204627,69204627,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/company/69204627/,60,Digital Egypt Builders Initiative- DEBI,https://www.linkedin.com/company/69204627/,2023-05-05T03:14:03.810Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/digital-egypt-builders-initiative-debi/,,,

It was the third university in Egypt after Fouad I University and Farouk I University (Cairo and Alexandria Universities). After the 1952 revolution, it was thought that it would be more appropriate to assign the university a name, Heliopolis “the city of the sun” that would be a permanent reminder of the oldest Egyptian University in history that was very famous in science and astronomy in the pharaonic era. In November 1952, the historical Zaafran palace was chosen to be the university headquarters. The palace was surrounded by 100 acres of green area. It was established during the period of Ismail Pasha. The Egyptian–English treaty was signed there in 1936. In 1954, at the recommendation of the university council, a law was passed changing the name to the “University of Ain Shams”. During the last few years, the palace was renovated to maintain its original architectural as well as artistic features. Throughout its history, the university has always been in continuous development. Its graduates are highly distinguished in the employment market. The university includes the following faculties and institutes: Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Commerce, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Women for Arts, Science and Education, Faculty of Languages (Al–Alsun), Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Faculty of Computer Science and Information, Faculty of Nursing, Institute of Environmental Studies and Research and Institute of Postgraduate Childhood Studies.",,102604,http://eng.shams.edu.eg,eng.shams.edu.eg,,EG,,Education Administration Programs,"501-1,000 employees",,,653005,653005,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/company/653005/,1651,"Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University",https://www.linkedin.com/company/653005/,2023-05-05T03:14:50.661Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/faculty-of-engineering-ain-shams-university/,,,

In September 1999, Egypt launched the National Program to develop the Communications and Information Technology (ICT) sector in Egypt. The program aims to foster the development of an information society in Egypt and stimulate the growth of a strong, competitive, vibrant, export-oriented ICT sector. The cornerstone of this program was the establishment of the new Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, in October 1999, to lead these efforts.

Then, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) launched a National Plan for ICT, establishing multi-disciplinary projects and initiatives related to vital sectors, such as education and health.

Our mission is to create meaningful jobs for millions of people, by teaching them how to build human-centered AI products.

Our Philosophy

In the age of software, innovative organizations invest significantly to build their own proprietary digital products that offer a great User Experience (UX) and leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI).

This omnipresent AI software layer opens a new dimension where operations, products and services merge into one user experience. Whether the user is an employee, another business, or a customer, the cost, speed, and ease of utilizing the AI layer becomes the most important differentiators between winners and losers in globally competitive marketplaces.

Off the shelf software does not differentiate you, nor does it provide the integration, flexibility, and affordability you need to succeed. In the age of software, we believe the only way to win is through bespoke digital products where you own the IP and have the ability to prioritize new features.

However, building teams that build AI with great UX is incredibly hard. Our value proposition is that we provide you with teams that will design, build, support and maintain those products.

Why choose bld.ai

Experience. Our team has been building AI software with great UX for 20 years. We have both the academic and practical experience required to manage expectations and focus on the important parts of building machine learning engines successfully.

Speed. We deploy nimble teams of 3-7 people to quickly build tools, deploy features and improve functionality. Most importantly, our teams have worked together in the past and operate as full stack, end-to-end squads.

IP Ownership. All the IP we create is the sole property of those we serve. We build it from the ground up working hand-in-hand with you. Bespoke software is less expensive and provides better integration and scale.","Let’s design, build, and maintain human-centered AI products together.",6756,https://bld.ai,https://bld.ai,Boca Raton,"Boca Raton, FL 33496, US",,Internet Publishing,201-500 employees,"Boca Raton, FL",2017,13653729,13653729,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/company/13653729/,225,bld.ai,https://www.linkedin.com/company/13653729/,2023-05-05T03:56:34.988Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/bldai/,"UI design, UX design, Data Science, AI, Software Development, and Product Management",,

We empower global retail leaders to make better decisions by fusing all sources of data into a clear view across the business.
 
For over 13 years, we have been helping our clients to better understand their business by consolidating complex insights into compelling stories, with distinct chapters and clear plotlines leading to epiphanies of “I know exactly what actions to take next” for our clients.
 
The Fusion MethodTM takes the bias and politics out of competing data sets. It provides the best customized analytics, advanced mathematically modeling, and speed to fuse multiple data sources from inside and outside the organization. With its ability to generate unique perspectives and drive clear actions, Fusion is the secret weapon for growing retailers, and is the only data analytics and advisory company that delivers One Version of The Truth across your enterprise. 
 
We achieve all the above by mathematically fusing over 42 internal & external data sources and over 140 enterprise metrics measured across the organization via our proprietary AI model built off of Bayesian statistics. As a wholly different statistical paradigm from traditional methods, Bayesian statistics has been explored and validated for three centuries but has only recently become practical with advances in AI.
 
The Fusion Process:
 
- Uncover and remove all blind spots in the business
- Triangulate multiple data sources for each metric to remove noise and find 
 the actual signal
- Fuse/integrate all the metrics so you can see a clear picture of what is working and what is not
- Rack & stack the results into clear outlines so your team can prioritize
- Work with you to build an action plan, then implement and review
